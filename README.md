# Project Title
CharityHero is a website where you can create charity requests as well as view and donate to charities of your choice. This Project was done by a team of five members over the course of five days. We used Typescript, React and Chakra UI for frontend, while the back-end was built using Node.js with the Express framework, and MongoDB was employed as the database.
